ExoGS is a low-cost, robot-free framework that leverages a custom passive exoskeleton to capture human manipulation and convert it into editable 3D Gaussian Splatting sequences. By decoupling the robot, objects, and environment, it supports geometry-consistent data generation and augmentation in simulation. Additionally, the system integrates a lightweight Mask Adapter that mitigates domain shift by introducing semantic constraints, thereby guiding learned policies to focus on interaction-relevant features.

## TODO
- Release sim-to-real pipeline (**January 20th, 2026**)
- Release example datasets (**January 20th, 2026**)
- Release our policy training infrastructure and codes of Mask Adapter (**January 20th, 2026**)
